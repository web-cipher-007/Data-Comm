Circuit Switching:</b><br>In circuit switching, a dedicated, physical communication path (a 'circuit') is established between two endpoints before the data transfer begins. This connection is maintained for the entire duration of the communication.<br><ul><li><b>Pros:</b> Guaranteed constant bandwidth, fixed and minimal transmission delay (after connection setup), simple data transfer process with no packets or headers.</li><li><b>Cons:</b> Inefficient use of bandwidth (channel is reserved even if no data is being sent), long connection setup time, calls can be blocked if all circuits are busy.</li><li><b>Example:</b> The traditional public telephone network (PSTN).</li></ul><hr class='my-2'><b>2. Packet Switching:</b><br>In packet switching, data is broken down into smaller, manageable blocks called packets. Each packet contains a header with source and destination address information. These packets are then sent independently through the network and reassembled at the destination.<br><ul><li><b>Pros:</b> Very efficient use of network bandwidth, more robust as packets can be rerouted around network failures, allows more users to share the network simultaneously.</li><li><b>Cons:</b> Variable and unpredictable delay (jitter) for packets, requires more complex protocols for error checking and reassembly, packets can be lost or arrive out of order.</li><li><b>Example:</b> The Internet (using TCP/IP protocol).</li></ul><hr class='my-2'><b>3. Message Switching:</b><br>This is a store-and-forward technique. The entire message is sent from the source to the first intermediate node, which stores it completely before forwarding it to the next node along the path. This process repeats until the message reaches its destination.<br><ul><li><b>Pros:</b> More efficient channel utilization than circuit switching, does not require a dedicated path, messages can be stored and sent when a channel becomes available.</li><li><b>Cons:</b> High latency because each node must receive the entire message before forwarding, requires nodes to have large storage capacity, not suitable for real-time applications.</li><li><b>Example:</b> Early telegraph and email systems.</li></ul>" },
                    { question: "Explain the concept of Datagram networks and Virtual-Circuit networks in packet switching.", year: "2079 Bhadra", type: "Regular", marks: "[8]", answer: "Packet-switched networks can be implemented in two main ways: Datagram networks and Virtual-Circuit networks.<br><br><b>1. Datagram Networks (Connectionless):</b><br>In a datagram network, each packet is treated as an independent entity, called a datagram. The network makes a routing decision for each packet individually based on the destination address contained in its header. There is no concept of a pre-established connection.<br><ul><li><b>Path:</b> Packets belonging to the same message may travel along different paths to reach the destination.</li><li><b>State:</b> Routers do not store any state information about the flow of packets.</li><li><b>Ordering:</b> Packets can arrive at the destination out of order and may be lost. The end systems are responsible for reordering and error recovery.</li><li><b>Analogy:</b> Sending a letter through the postal service.</li><li><b>Example:</b> The Internet's IP (Internet Protocol) layer is a datagram network.</li></ul><br><b>2. Virtual-Circuit Networks (Connection-Oriented):</b><br>In a virtual-circuit network, a logical path, or 'virtual circuit' (VC), is established between the source and destination before any data packets are sent. All packets for that communication session then follow this same pre-determined path.<br><ul><li><b>Phases:</b> Communication involves three phases: 1) VC Setup (a path is established and a Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) is assigned), 2) Data Transfer (packets are forwarded based on their VCI), and 3) VC Teardown (the connection is terminated).</li><li><b>Path:</b> All packets follow the same path.</li><li><b>State:</b> Each router along the path maintains state information for each active virtual circuit.</li><li><b>Ordering:</b> Because packets follow the same route, they generally arrive in the correct order.</li><li><b>Analogy:</b> The traditional telephone system, but with logical instead of physical circuits.</li><li><b>Example:</b> Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay networks.</li></ul>" },
                    { question: "Write a short note on: Circuit Switching", year: "2076 Chaitra", type: "Regular", marks: "[4]", answer: "Circuit switching is a communication method that establishes a dedicated, end-to-end physical connection (a circuit) between two devices before they can communicate. This method operates in three distinct phases: <br><br>1.  <b>Circuit Establishment:</b> A dedicated path is set up from the source to the destination through various switches in the network. Resources like bandwidth and switch capacity are reserved along this path. <br>2.  <b>Data Transfer:</b> Once the circuit is established, data is transmitted continuously from source to destination without any packet headers, as the path is already determined. This results in a very low and constant delay. <br>3.  <b>Circuit Disconnect:</b> When the communication is complete, the connection is terminated, and the reserved resources are released, becoming available for other calls. <br><br>The primary advantage of circuit switching is the guaranteed quality of service due to the dedicated channel. However, its main disadvantage is inefficiency, as the channel resources are exclusively allocated and remain idle if no data is being transferred. The classic example is the traditional telephone network." }
